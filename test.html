<h2> THE STORY ABOUT MY LIFE SINCE 2007 is below as follows </h2>
<p> I was 17 then. Every friend of mine had some crush or so-called love story. The only men I liked were on the silver screen. I could spend hours and days just looking at George Clooney and Pierce Bronson. The boys of my age, soon to be called guys, were never on my attractive list. I spent least of my time thinking about them. That ‚ÄòSuburban Girl‚Äô had hit me real hard! Alec Baldwin was my choice.

Every time our girlfriends‚Äô gang hung out, the talks were divided into two sections- Section A- studies, college plans, and Section- B for Boys. Whenever they asked me if I liked or felt like dating someone I had no clue about the answer. Some thought I was a bit snobbish because of that, but I was in some fantasy artsy land where the girl thought she would fall for an older, mature guy. Damn, The Suburban girl and Monica dating Richard!

But constant hearing of such talks made me wonder, ‚ÄúIs there something wrong with me? Am I missing something? What if this attitude of mine doesn‚Äôt make me a charming likable girl later on? Am I failing in some preliminary ‚Äòliking‚Äô test? ‚Äù

I somehow knew I gave a strong negative vibe in case someone tried to approach me. Even though I wasn‚Äôt very keen to date anyone, I wondered if this was a prep period. I really wished it wasn‚Äôt some kind of curse which would go along with me for years to go. Frankly, sometimes I used to get worried about my future dating scene. Funny Funny 17! I do smile remembering what was I thinking then.

On a Friday evening, I went to attend my friend‚Äôs birthday party. She just turned 18 and so it was a big one. Almost everyone I knew was there. As reached the gang table, all were in some serious gossip discussion- looked like Section B talks. But as I joined them, topic took a disrupted turn. Got curious but didn‚Äôt bother much.

I observed that almost everyone was behaving a bit differently with me. Not bad but different. Some were making me feel like a celebrity, and few were perpetually staring at me from head to toe. I checked my dress twice if something was wrong. ‚ÄúIs it my new lip gloss? May be something on my face?‚Äù I gave up. When the party was about to wrap up, a very close friend of mine finally talked about it.

Lastly, I got the news. The awkwardness was all about the breakup of a famous pseudo couple of our class. How come I was involved? The rumor was that the the guy dumped my friend because of me. He apparently liked me. So he befriended her to talk to me and she bought it. Finally, when the secret got revealed, I was somehow the reason for all this mess. I, on the other hand, had already put that boy in the Zoolander category.

    I made my reaction sound hogwash. But, inside, I suddenly felt myself in an acceptance zone.

Being a bit different somehow was no more a concern. The small space within me which wanted the confirmation was filled. Now, after these many years, I laugh at the fact that I wanted an affirmation for my choices. That‚Äôs what being a teenager is like. Surely a bit bobbling and amusing.

Anyway, since the news was already on fire, the guy asked me out for coffee. I went and very nicely told him that I wasn‚Äôt interested in him. He was sweet enough to accept it and still paid for my cup of coffee.

From that very day I was ready to be 18!

P.S. The Zoolander guy is still in touch with me and I am sure he is smiling while reading this :).   </p>
